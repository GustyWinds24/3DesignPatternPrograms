All three programs were written to clean code standards according to the infamous Uncle Bob.
The command design pattern programs simulates a simple firing of a gun, the observer design
pattern simulates a cook flipping burgers and serer them and the state design pattern
simulates a simple test of various RPG characters against a common enemy. Each program has
an included UML class diagram to give a visual to see how the design patterns are being used.
